# Test Case Template

Here’s a commonly used structure for detailed test documentation. Each field serves a specific purpose in planning, execution, and reporting.

## Field

### Description

**Test Case ID**
A unique identifier (e.g., E2E-001). Ensures tracking and easy reference in test management tools (Jira, TestRail, etc.).

**Test Case Name**
A short, descriptive name (e.g., “Book Flight + Hotel Package”).

**Description/Goal**
High-level overview of the scenario: why we are testing it and what outcome we expect to validate.

**Preconditions**
Any setup required before executing (e.g., user must be logged in, existing booking needed, specific environment).

**Test Data**
Data inputs unique to this scenario: city names, dates, user credentials, coupons, etc.

**Steps**
The sequential actions the tester (or automated script) will perform.

**Expected Result**
What the application should do or display after the steps are followed.

**Priority**
Indicates the importance (High, Medium, Low) or order in which this test should be run.

**Additional Notes**
Space for any extra info: post-conditions, references to design docs, known issues, or clarifications.

## Why Each Field Is Important

**Test Case ID**
Allows easy correlation between test documentation, bug reports, and automation scripts.

**Test Case Name**
Quickly summarizes the scenario’s purpose.

**Description/Goal**
Clarifies why the test matters from a business or user standpoint.

**Preconditions**
Ensures the environment or state is correct before testing (reduces confusion and false failures).

**Test Data**
Centralizes all the input values needed, ensuring testers don’t guess or skip crucial data.

**Steps**
Guides testers or automation frameworks step by step, promoting repeatability and consistency.

**Expected Result**
Defines success criteria; we compare the actual outcome against this standard.

**Priority**
Helps teams run the most critical tests first if time or resources are limited.

**Additional Notes**
Captures any ancillary info that might be relevant to the test or future maintainers.
